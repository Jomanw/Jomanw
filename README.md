- 👋 Hi, I’m Jordan! (@Jomanw)
- 👀 I’m interested in Open Science, Evolutionary Computation, Incentive Systems, and Social Dynamics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the world of work outside of the standard paths.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - ML Research projects related to Evolutionary Computation, Open-Endedness, Novelty Search
  - Metascience projects (tools for researchers, data analysis on the progress of science, running experimental research / learning sprints)
  - Co-learning technical topics and publishing guides that make it easier for others to learn what we learned
- 📫 How to reach me: jordmanwick at gmail dot com
